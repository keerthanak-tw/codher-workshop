## AWS Workshop Pre-requisites

###### The focus of the workshop is to learn what the services are and how to configure them. We will not be encouraging any code specific doubts.
##### Please make sure you have the following setups ready as we will not be spending time on configuring these.


### Setups needed for workshop
#### Local setup
1. For demo purposes, we would be using **Nodejs**. Please make sure you have installed Nodejs (**14.x** preferred). (Refer - [Downloading and installing Node.js and npm | npm Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) )
2. Make sure you have **cloned the repo** (or download as zip in case you don’t have git in your system).
3. Once the above steps are done, open the ui and backend folders as ***separate projects*** in any IDE of your choice and run **npm install**.
4. We would be using **Postman** for testing the APIs we create during the demo. You can choose any way you prefer (postman, curl commands etc.) to test during the demo.

#### AWS setup
If you don’t have an AWS account, create one within ‘free tier’ (of course, this is not required if you are here only to learn about what and why of the services).
